**Version:** 2.1.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-09  
**Product:** EnterpriseFlow Business Intelligence and Analytics Platform

## Executive Summary

EnterpriseFlow is a cloud-native business intelligence platform designed for enterprise-scale data analytics, reporting, and workflow automation. This document outlines the technical architecture, security framework, performance characteristics, and functional capabilities.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
The platform implements comprehensive multi-factor authentication using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) tokens for all user access. MFA is mandatory for administrative accounts and optional for standard users. The system supports:

- TOTP-based authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)
- SMS-based verification codes as backup
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn) for high-security environments
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
The platform implements granular role-based access control with the following security principles:

- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Hierarchical role inheritance with permission delegation
- Dynamic permission assignment based on data classification
- Audit logging for all authentication and authorization events
- Session management with configurable timeout policies (15-480 minutes)

### Data Encryption and Security

**Encryption Standards**
All data is protected using industry-standard encryption protocols:

- Data at rest: AES-256 encryption with key rotation every 90 days
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3 for all client communications
- Database encryption: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with HSM key management
- API security: OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens with JWT signatures
- Certificate management: Automated certificate renewal and pinning

**Security Compliance**
The platform maintains compliance with multiple security frameworks:

- SOC 2 Type II certification for security and availability
- ISO 27001 information security management
- PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance for payment data handling
- GDPR compliance with data protection and privacy controls
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare data processing
